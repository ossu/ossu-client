        This is a <b>solid path</b> for those of you who want to complete a <strong>Computer Science</strong> course on your own time, for free, with courses from the <strong>best universities</strong> in the World. In our curriculum, we gave preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) style courses because those courses were created with our style of learning in mind.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation &amp; Preparation</h2>
      <p>Here are two interesting links that can make <b><b>all</b></b> the difference in your journey.</p>
      <p>The first one is a motivational video that shows a guy that went through the "MIT Challenge", that consists in learning the entire <b>4-year</b> MIT curriculum for Computer Science in <b>1 year</b>.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/">MIT Challenge</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>The second link is a MOOC that will teach you learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. These are <b>fundamental abilities</b> to succeed in our journey.</p>

      <h2>How to use our site</h2>

      <h3>Order of the classes</h3>

      <p>Our curriculum was developed to be consumed in a linear approach. What does this mean? That you should complete one course at a time.</p>

      <p>The courses are already in the order that you should complete them. Just start in the <strong>Introduction to Computer Science</strong> section and after finishing the first course, start the next one.</p>

      <p><b>If the course isn't open, do it anyway with the resources from the previous class.</b></p>

      <h3>Should I take all courses?</h3>

      <p><b>Yes</b>! The intention is to conclude <b>all</b> the courses listed here!</p>

      <h3>Duration of the project</h3>

      <p>It may take longer to complete all of the classes compared to a regular CS course, but I can <b>guarantee</b> you that your <b>reward</b> will be proportional to <b>your motivation/dedication</b>!</p>

      <p>You must focus on your <b>habit</b>, and <b>forget</b> about goals. Try to invest 1 ~ 2 hours <b>every day</b> studying this curriculum. If you do this, <b>inevitably</b> you'll finish this curriculum.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <h3>Project Based</h3>

      <p>Here in <strong>OSS University</strong>, you do not need to take exams, because we are focused on <strong>real projects</strong>!</p>

      <p>In order to show for everyone that you <b>successfully</b> finished a course, you should create a <strong>real project</strong>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>&laquo;What does it mean?&raquo;</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>After finish a course, you should think about a <b>real world problem</b> that you can solve using the acquired knowledge in the course. You don't need to create a big project, but you must create something to <b>validate</b> and <b>consolidate</b> your knowledge, and also to show to the world that you are capable to create something useful with the concepts that you learned.</p>

      <p>The projects of all students will be listed on their public pages. Submit your project's repository to your personal profile after you conclude it.</p>

      <p><b>You can create this project alone or with other students!</b></p>

      </ul>

      <p>And you should also...</p>

      <h3>Be creative!</h3>

      <p>This is a <b>crucial</b> part of your journey through all those courses.</p>

      <p>You <b>need</b> to have in mind that what you are able to <b>create</b> with the concepts that you learned will be your certificate and <b>this is what really matters</b>!</p>

      <p>In order to show that you <b>really</b> learned those things, you need to be <b>creative</b>!</p>

      <p>Here are some tips about how you can do that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><b>Articles</b>: create blog posts to synthesize/summarize what you learned.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>GitHub repository</b>: keep your course's files organized in a GH repository, so in that way other students can use it to study with your annotations.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Cooperative work</h3>

      <p><b>We love cooperative work</b>! Use our <a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#community">channels</a> to communicate with other fellows to combine and create new projects!</p>

      <h3>Which programming languages should I use?</h3>

      <p>My friend, here is the best part of liberty! You can use <b>any</b> language that you want to complete the courses.</p>

      <p>The important thing for each course is to <b>internalize</b> the <b>core concepts</b> and to be able to use them with whatever tool (programming language) that you wish.</p>

      <h3>Content Policy</h3>

      <p>You must share <b>only</b> files that you are <b>allowed</b> to! <b>Do NOT disrespect the code of conduct</b> that you signed in the beginning of some courses.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science/blob/master/README.md#be-creative">Be creative </a>in order to show your progress!</p>
